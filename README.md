# Grocery Purchase Proposal

A Python tool that recommends grocery items using Apriori-based association rule mining on the “Groceries” dataset.

## Overview

This project analyzes transaction data from a grocery store and provides item recommendations based on frequently purchased item sets. By applying the Apriori algorithm, the tool finds association rules that can help users discover which products are often bought together.

## Features

- Association rule mining with the Apriori algorithm
- Analysis on the popular “Groceries” dataset
- Recommendation of grocery items that are frequently bought together
- User-friendly and easy to use

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `mlxtend` (for Apriori algorithm)

You can install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas mlxtend
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KaanDRoid/Grocery-purchase-proposal.git
    cd Grocery-purchase-proposal
    ```

2. Make sure the “Groceries” dataset is available in the project directory.

3. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to get recommendations.
